# ðŸŒŽ Traslations

To support multilingualism, you can use the inbuilt translation system described in the previous section. Translations are stored in the `strings` folder as YAML files, where the language code is used as the file name, e.g. `ru.yaml` or `en.yaml`.

### Step 1: Creating translation files
Create YAML files in the `strings` folder with language codes as names. For example:

```yaml
# en.yaml
help:
  header: "Header description"
```

### Step 2: Load translations
After loading the module, the `S` class attribute will store the currently selected language based on the bot's config. If no such language is found, the fallback language specified in the config will be used. If fallback language is not found, the first available language will be selected.

- The current language can be obtained via the `cur_lang` attribute.
- All loaded translations are available via the `rawS` attribute.

### Step 3: Using translations
An example of using translations in code:

```python
text = self.S["help"]["header"]
```

You can also embed variables in the translation:

```python
variable = data
text = self.S["help"]["header"].format(variable=variable)
```

In the localization file, it would look like this:

```yaml
help:
  header: header description {variable}
```
