# ðŸŒŽ Traslations

To support multilingualism, you can use the built-in translation system described in the previous section. In the `strings` folder you need to create YAML files with the language code as the name, for example `ru.yaml` or `en.yaml`. After loading the module, the attribute of class `S` will contain the current language selected on the basis of the bot's config, or, if it is not found, the fallback language (also specified in the config). If it is not found, the first one is chosen. At any time, the current language can be obtained in the `cur_lang` attribute, and all loaded translations in `rawS`.

```python
text = self.S["help"]["header"]
```
