# üêç Using 3rd party python packages

If the module requires any third-party library, the dependencies can be specified in the `requirements.txt` file at the root of the module folder, in the usual `pip` format. The packages will be automatically installed with the module, and automatically removed when the module is uninstalled. If several modules depend on the same package, that package will not be removed with the module.
