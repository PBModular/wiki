# 📁 Multifiling
### Introduction

The main advantage of modules as separate directories is the ability to organise the code in a simple and clear way. This is helped by the `ModuleExtension` class, which allows you to access some attributes of the main class (e.g. translations, database) outside of it, as well as register handler functions. Let's create a new extension for our module.

### Step 1: Create a new extension
Create a new file and declare an extension class in it that will inherit `ModuleExtension` from `base.mod_ext`:

An example of creating an extension:
```python
from base.mod_ext import ModuleExtension
from base.module import command

from pyrogram.types import Message


class LogsExtension(ModuleExtension):
    @command('logs')
    async def logs_cmd(self, _, message: Message):
...
```

### Step 2: Register the extension in the main module class
Once an extension is created, it must be registered in the main module class. This is done by overriding the `module_extensions` property-method:

```python
# Extensions
from .extensions.mod_manage import ModManageExtension
from .extensions.logs import LogsExtension
from .extensions.permissions import PermissionsExtension

class CoreModule(BaseModule):
    @property
    def module_extensions(self) -> list[Type[ModuleExtension]]:
        return [
            ModManageExtension,
            LogsExtension,
            PermissionsExtension
        ]
```
:::info
The `module_extensions` method returns a list of all extension classes to be used in the module.

Now your extensions will be integrated into the main module and you can organise your code more efficiently by distributing functions across different files.
