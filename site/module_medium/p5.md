# ðŸ“ƒ Help page

You can use 2 approaches to provide a help page.

1. **Automatic generation of help page.** Calling the `/help` ModName command shows a list of all commands, as well as their descriptions from the function dockstring (text inside triple quotes). All you need to do is just add short descriptions to each function (you can see an example above)
2. **Manual help page.** Implemented by the `help_page` property-method override, which returns a string that will be sent as text when the `/help ModName` command is invoked:

```python
# Description from source
@property
 def help_page(self) -> Optional[str]:
     """
     Help string to be displayed in Core module help command. Highly recommended to set this!
     Defaults to auto-generated command listing, which uses callback func __doc__ for description
     """
     return self.__auto_help
```
