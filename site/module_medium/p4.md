# ☑️ Using /start

Because of the modularity of the bot, it would be wrong to assign the `/start` command to one particular module. So, each module can register its own `/start ModName` command handler! This is done by overriding the `start_cmd` method in the module class (works only in the module class itself, not supported in extensions). The arguments are the same as for all other command handlers:

```python
async def start_cmd(self, _, message: Message):
    """Initialize database entry for chat"""
```
