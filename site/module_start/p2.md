# 📓Module structure
### Introduction

A module is a Python module (directory with `__init__.py` file) of a special structure.

**Пример структуры модуля:**
```
core
├── extensions
│   ├── logs.py
│   ├── mod_manage.py
│   └── permissions.py
├── info.yaml
├── __init__.py
├── main.py
└── strings
    ├── en.yaml
    └── ru.yaml
```

### Main components

1. `BaseModule`: This is the super class that provides the API for the module and performs its initialisation. Your module class must inherit from `BaseModule`.

```python
from base.module import BaseModule

class CoreModule(BaseModule):
```

::: warning
In `__init__.py` there must be an import of a new module class, otherwise the loader just won't see it
:::

```python
from .main import CoreModule
```

2. `info.yaml`: This YAML file contains information about the module: title, author, version, description and permissions. Example:

All information about the module is described in the YAML file `info.yaml`. It includes: title, author, version, description, and permissions (more about them later). An example of such a file:

```python
info:
  name: BestModule
  author: Developers
  version: 0.0.1
  description: Just best module, lol
  src_url: https://bestgit.org/BestModule
  python: 3.12 # Optional

# Use raw loader object. Very dangerous permission!
permissions:
  - use_loader
```

::: info
`python` - Version of Python on which the module was developed/works. You don't have to specify. Only adds a warning to the log on startup if the system (or venv) has a different version of Python.

3. Command creation: Module commands are created as class methods with arguments similar to a normal [handler in Pyrogram](https://docs.pyrogram.org/start/updates), except that special decorators must be used (more details in the next section).

4. `ModuleExtension`: These classes allow you to split the module code into multiple files, preserving the important attributes of the class. In the example above, the extension files are in the extensions folder, but you can organise them as you wish.

5. Translation system: The module includes a built-in translation system. When loading, it checks the strings folder and loads translation files as dictionaries into the `rawS` attribute. The currently active language is then selected (specified in the bot's config) and the translations are loaded into the `S` attribute. [Read more...](/module_medium/p2)
