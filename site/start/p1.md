# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to PBModular Wiki!

**PBModular** is a lightweight and flexible bot framework designed for anything you code. Something between a userbot and a standard bot.

All the information you need to develop and maintain modules is located here. So if you have decided to start, go for it! We will be only glad to receive new contributions!

To start development, install the local bot instance according to the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/PBModular/bot?tab=readme-ov-file#pbmodular).
