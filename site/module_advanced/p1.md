# ☑️ Module permissions

The system of permissions for modules is implemented in the bot. What does it mean? A module can access additional features by specifying extensions in `info.yaml.` When installing a module, its permissions are shown to the user, and only after his consent the installation continues.

There are currently 3 permits available:

- `use_db` - database usage (not strict dependency, if the database is disabled in the bot's config, the module can work)

- `require_db` - use of the database by the module (strict dependency, if the database is disabled and the module requires it, it will be skipped when loaded)

- `use_loader`- use of ModuleLoader object (the most dangerous permission, because with it the module gets control over the whole "inside" of the bot).

::: info
An example of setting permissions can be seen in the description of bot structure and modules.
