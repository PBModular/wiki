# ðŸ”ƒ Callback functions

The module has several colback functions that are called as they are initialized:

- `def on_init` - Called after Stage2, due to the peculiarities of asynchronous programming the availability of the database is not guaranteed
- `async def on_db_ready` - Called immediately after full database initialization, useful to use if you need to work with the database immediately after startup

**Example usage:**

```python
async def on_db_ready(self):
    async with self.db.session_maker() as session:
        # load chat states from database
```
